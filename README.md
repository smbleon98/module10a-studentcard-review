# Module 10A – StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This is a React code review assignment. I reviewed the StudentCard component and added comments to 
explain the logic behind props, state, and interactivity.

## What I Learned
- How to use and identify props and state
--- For some reason, this time around, the hardest part of this assignment was setting up my repository for some reason.
Ultimately, I deleted every single previous folder and project and started over from scratch.
- How toggle functionality works with useState
--- showBio is the state variable. 
--- setShowBio is the function that updates it. 
toggle functionality indirectly updates the showBio state variable as well by calling setShowBio, which updates the showBio state variable.
---This exercise helped me understand the jargon better. I initially thought that the toggle function updated the state, but that turned out not to be the case.
- How to better document and explain React components
--- Code reviews are the assignments I find the most value in because it gives working code and affords me the opportunity to trace the code and go line by line to understand what each piece, each keyword does to produce what we see on the screen.
